            <section class="about">
                <p>I am an Engineer with a solid skill set in developing Software Systems and Enterprise Product Design. I have strong experience developing backend layers (Data Integration/ETL/Replication/Sharding/NoSQL DB), middleware (transaction processing/messaging), and API development (REST/ODATA/SOAP/Microservices). I have built and been involved in a good number of software projects for academia and budding startup communities since 2013. I love code design patterns and refactoring legacy code. I am an avid follower of <a href="https://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler's</a> experiences in Software System development.</p>
                <p>I am currently working as a Technical Product Manager at <a href="https://www.accurate.com/">Accurate Background</a>. I previously worked as a Senior Product Manager at <a href="https://www.sumtotalsystems.com/">SumTotal Systems - a Cornerstone Ondemand Company</a>. I gained a keen interest in computing research in my early professional career. I started working as a graduate software researcher in 2014 in the area of Software Quality Engineering at <a href="https://serc.iiit.ac.in/">Software Engineering Research Center, IIIT Hyderabad</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~raghu.reddy/Home.html">Prof. Y. Raghu Reddy</a>. I managed to coin a software quality metric called Defect Dependency Degree. I developed a rough-set theory-based approach to calculate a dependency of a defect over the rest of the defects in a Large Scale Integrated Software Product, published my <a href="http://web2py.iiit.ac.in/research_centres/publications/view_publication/mastersthesis/466">dissertation</a> as part of my Master of Science by Research in 2016.</p>
                <p>I have built a requirement specification tool called <a href="https://saianirudh-karri.gitbook.io/vreqst/">VReqST</a> to specify requirements for Virtual Reality Software Products as part of my Doctoral Research. I was awarded PhD in Computer Science in June, 2024.</p>
                <p>Apart from computing research, I dedicate my time to cooking, Oil on Canvas, Plants, and my Mom!</p>
